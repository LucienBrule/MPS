This is an HID example that demonstrates Human Interface Device (HID)
on USB Device.

Detailed description is available on:
www.keil.com/pack/doc/MW/USB/html/dev_hid_tutorial.html

Board:                  ST 'STM32F769I-Discovery'
Microcontroller:        ST 'STM32F769NIH6'
Clock Settings:         XTAL       =  25 MHz
                        CPUCLK     = 216 MHz
                        USB HS CLK =  60 MHz (from external ULPI PHY)
USB High-speed:         USB_HS (connector CN15)
User Interface:         input:  User button
                        output: LD1 and LD2

The example demonstrates a Human Interface Device. The board LED and
push button can be accessed from the PC through a custom
HID Client Program (<Keil-root>\ARM\Utilities\HID_Client\Release\HIDClient.exe).

The program is available for target(s):
- Debug:
  - Compiler optimization Level 1
  - Debug USB library
  - Enabled Event Recorder
- Release:
  - Compiler optimization Level 3
  - Release USB library
